# WebUtvCalculator

Simple calculator that handles addition, subtraction, division, multiplcation, modulo and power of base.
It handles both negative and positive numbers, as well as decimals.

Too big calculations may crash it as it only uses the double datatype to store numbers, but it should be well enough for something that doesn't require a proper caluclator.

## How to use
Simply push in your numbers using your mouse and hit = (or enter on your keyboard).
If you enter multiple calculations (i.e 1+5+6) it will calculate them in order and show the end result.

For this example it would be 

1+5 = 6

6+6 = 12

## TODO
- Allow input using numpad
- Add heavy metal music for the genuine calculator experience
